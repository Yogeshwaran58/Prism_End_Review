This script does the following tasks,

1. It defines a list of icon names to swap.
2. It sets source and destination directories for images and JSON files.
3. It defines functions for various tasks like calculating distance, finding suitable positions for icons, appending data to JSON files, and more.
4. The `process_images()` function iterates through destination images and attempts to swap icons from source images into them.
5. It contains a `find_source_with_icon()` function to find a source image containing a specific icon.
6. It validates directories' existence and executes the main function `main()`.

Overall, the script swaps specified icons from source images into destination images while ensuring proper positioning and avoiding overlap. 
It updates corresponding JSON files with the new icon metadata.
