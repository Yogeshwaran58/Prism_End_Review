This Python function, `swap_regions`, swaps regions of interest (ROIs) between two images specified by their file paths. It takes as input the paths to two images (`image_path_1` and `image_path_2`), the bounding boxes of the regions to be swapped (`bbox1` and `bbox2`), and the paths where the resulting images with swapped regions will be saved (`save_path_1` and `save_path_2`).

1. It reads the input images using OpenCV (`cv2.imread()`).
2. It checks if the images are loaded successfully.
3. It extracts the specified regions of interest from both images using slicing.
4. It swaps the extracted regions between the two images.
5. It draws rectangles around the swapped regions on the images for visualization using `cv2.rectangle()`.
6. It saves the resulting images with swapped regions to the specified paths using `cv2.imwrite()`.
