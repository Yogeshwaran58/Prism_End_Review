This Python script loads an image using OpenCV, draws bounding boxes around specified objects on the image, and saves the resulting image with bounding boxes.

1. It loads an image from the specified path using OpenCV (`cv2.imread()`).
2. It checks if the image is loaded successfully.
3. It defines a dictionary `coordinates` containing object names and their corresponding bounding box coordinates.
4. It iterates over each object in `coordinates` and draws a rectangle around it on the loaded image using `cv2.rectangle()`.
5. It specifies the output path where the resulting image with bounding boxes will be saved.
6. It saves the image with bounding boxes to the specified output path using `cv2.imwrite()`.
