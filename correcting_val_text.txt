This script does the following task,

1. It defines two directories: one containing text files (`dir_texts`) and the other containing image files (`dir_images`).
2. It uses the `glob` module to retrieve all text files (`*.txt`) and image files (`*.*`) within their respective directories.
3. It extracts the base filenames (without extensions) of the text and image files.
4. It finds text files that do not have corresponding image files by subtracting the set of image file names from the set of text file names.
5. It iterates over the filenames of text files without corresponding images and deletes them using `os.remove()`.
6. It prints a message for each deleted file.
7. Finally, it prints a message indicating the completion of the processing.
