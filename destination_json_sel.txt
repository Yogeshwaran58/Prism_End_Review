This Python script iterates through image files in a specified directory.
For each image, it constructs the corresponding JSON filename by changing the extension.
It checks if the JSON file exists in another directory.
If the JSON file exists, it copies it to a new destination directory for filtered JSON files.
Finally, it prints a message indicating the completion of fetching corresponding JSON files.
