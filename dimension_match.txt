This Python script utilizes OpenCV to check images within a specified directory for the desired dimensions (1080x1920 pixels). 

- It iterates through files in the specified directory, filtering by common image file extensions.
- For each image, it attempts to load it using OpenCV.
- If loading fails, it prints a message indicating the failure and continues to the next image.
- If the image is successfully loaded, it checks its dimensions.
- Images with dimensions matching the desired width and height are stored in a list.
- If there are matching images, it prints their filenames.
- Otherwise, it prints a message indicating no images with the desired dimensions were found.
