This script iterates through the annotation files of all the images in the newly augmented dataset and display a histogram representing the no. of images with overlapping bounding boxes of icons.
The Smart Icon Placement algorithm incorporates techniques to prevent the overlapping of bounding boxes on patch pasting.
The very low concentration of images with overlaps signify the efficiency of the algorithm used for augmentation.
